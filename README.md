Less is More: Dimensionality Analysis of Pure Random  Orthogonal Search Through the Lens of Degrees of  Freedom

In this paper, we study how the notion of Degrees of Freedom influences the Pure Random Search (PRS) class of algorithms, with a special focus on the recently published Pure Random Orthogonal Search (PROS) algorithm.

The general observation is if we reduce the degrees of freedom, we get better Optimization performance, and hence the title: Less is More
